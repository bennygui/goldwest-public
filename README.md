This is the implementation of Gold West for BGA:
https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=goldwest

This is a copy of the original private repository, stripped of images to
prevent any copyright problems. I will try to update it when the main
repository changes, although it is likely not to change since the game is very
stable.

This is my first game on BGA and although the server side is splitted in
multiple files, the client side is all in one file, which is not optimal.
There are a few things that I should have done differently, like not using css
transform to resize the board since the BGA framework can already handle all of
this.

This matches version 240329-1525 on BGA.
